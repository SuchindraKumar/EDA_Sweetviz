# EDA_Sweetviz

### Sweetviz is an open-source Python library for generating highly detailed and interactive visualizations for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). It is designed to help data analysts and data scientists quickly understand and analyze complex datasets without requiring much coding.

### The library provides a simple API that enables users to generate a range of summary statistics and visualizations for datasets. It automatically detects the type of variables in a dataset, such as numerical, categorical, or ordinal, and generates appropriate visualizations for each variable type. Sweetviz provides a comprehensive set of visualizations, including bar charts, scatter plots, histograms, density plots, heatmaps, and correlation matrices.

### Sweetviz generates detailed HTML reports that can be easily shared with others, making it an effective tool for collaboration and communication. The reports are highly customizable, allowing users to tailor the visualizations to their specific needs. Sweetviz can also be used to compare two datasets, enabling users to identify differences and similarities between them.

### Overall, Sweetviz is a powerful EDA tool that can save data analysts and data scientists significant amounts of time while providing highly informative visualizations and statistics for datasets.
